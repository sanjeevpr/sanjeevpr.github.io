Today marks a great day for me because I have created this blog. I am have started blogging because I hope that this becomes a great place to for me express my ideas which never sees the light of the day. I don't want it like a diary that I would maintain. I will mostly be writing about things from technology to life experiences, and things I think that might help others.

## A quick intro about myself:
1. I am a software developer
2. Have around three years of experience
3. I am based in India
4. I am 28 y/o
5. I love solving problems and I am always curious about how things work the way they work
6. I love traveling, cooking, playing ukulele and guitar, and jam with my loved ones.
