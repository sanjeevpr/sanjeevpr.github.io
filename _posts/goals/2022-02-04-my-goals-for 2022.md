I have been thinking of getting better at coding and hence become a better developer. I want to become a better developer because this will enable me to get my dream job. Today, marks my journey of getting better each day. I will be thinking more about the progress rather then perfection.

## 1. Coding everyday
- Doing atleast two DSA question each day on Leetcode

## 2. Learning new tech
- Taking up AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate course

## 3. Learning the basics again
Learning basic concepts such as
- Data structures
- Algorithm
- Java concepts and Spring framework
- Design patterns
- Low Level Design
- Computer networks
- Operating systems
- DBMS
