So, a new year brings new hopes and goals. I would like this year to be the year of learning. This year is very important for me as I am married now and have moved to a new country. The recession has hit us already. I want myself to be ready at all times.

## 1. Coding everyday
- Doing atleast two DSA question each day on Leetcode.

## 2. Learning German
- Moving to new country poses various challenges when you do not know the language.

## 3. Learning the basics again
Learning basic concepts such as
- Data structures
- Algorithm
- Java concepts and Spring framework
- Design patterns
- Low Level Design
- Computer networks
- Operating systems
- DBMS

## 4. Writing articles
- Writing one article every two week on anything from life to new learning.

## 5. Fitness
- Running or going to the gym.
