The first month of the new year is always when we create new resolutions, dream about achieving the things that we could not achieve last year, and try to actually pursue them. The first month is always challenging because we have to fight through all the negatives that are not allowing us to start working on our new habits. Here are my learnings from January 2023.

1. It is very hard to say "no."
I have been in many situations where I failed to say no to something or someone just because I am not assertive enough, or maybe feel that people might not like me, or maybe the situation seems like this is absolutely necessary now. But, later, I find out that I should not have committed to such things.

2. Family matters most.
I have seen and experienced that in tough times, only your own will be on your side. We need to take great care of those people.

3. Marrying is not scary.
I am now married to the most genuinely nice lady that I know. I was not for a single moment rethinking my decision to marry her due to fear of responsibility or any other reasons. I think it only happens because you are marrying someone you really believe in and want on your side.

4. Staying alone now is tougher.
I stay alone now in Germany, which was already tough, but it has gotten tougher because I have left my wife at home. You are literally always alone. I need to make some new friends and meet them, or go to the office often to kill my loneliness.

5. There is nothing such as job security.
Although, as tech workers, we enjoy so many perks that a government employee might never enjoy. But they are always at peace because they are sure that they will be fired from their jobs. On the other hand, we always have to be one step ahead to prepare ourselves for new jobs if something of the sort happens.


So, these were my thoughts and learnings from the first month. I hope there are more such learnings.
