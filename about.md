## Introduction

Hello there! I'm Sanjiv, a curious and results-driven software engineer based in Berlin, Germany,
with a solid four-year track record in crafting robust and scalable software solutions. My expertise
spans the dynamic domains of finance and retail, where I've consistently delivered impactful
results.

Some of my noteworthy achievements include a 90% boost in API performance and a remarkable 100%
reduction in Kafka lag, both of which directly contributed to substantial increases in sales volume.

My technical proficiency centers around **Java**, with a strong command of technologies like **Apache
Kafka**, the **Spring** framework, and **microservices** architecture. I'm not limited to just one tool in the
toolbox, though. I've also put my skills to the test with Kotlin, Postgres, Elasticsearch,
Couchbase, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, and Kubernetes.

I consider myself an empathetic team player, always eager to collaborate effectively and foster a
positive work environment. Beyond that, I thrive as an innovative and creative thinker, consistently
seeking new and better ways to tackle challenges.

Let's connect and explore exciting opportunities to create impactful software solutions together!
